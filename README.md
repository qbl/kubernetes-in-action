# Kubernetes in Action - Learning Notes

## Before You Continue

This is my learning notes on the book Kubernetes in Action by Marko Luksa. Learning notes are the way I implemented [The Feynman Technique](https://medium.com/taking-note/learning-from-the-feynman-technique-5373014ad230). So, first and foremost, I hope these notes are useful to help me learning things. Therefore, these notes will be full of case studies from my own experience as they will reinforce my learning process.

Making these learning notes useful for others is just a stretch goal, at least for now. However, as it is crucial in Feynman Technique to try to explain what one learns to others, if you do find anything in these notes hard to comprehend, do not hesitate to send your feedback to my email at farabi.iqbal@gmail.com.
